## Hello in my to do webapp the 2nd verision
### this is the same to do app that is [here](https://github.com/ZeyadMoustafaKamal/to-do) but I did some improvements like
- I used the CBVs (class based views) instead of FBVs (function based views)
- I updated the method that I follow for the E-mail authentication so I will send a URL instead of a 6 digit code
- I added a functionality so the user can ask me to send him another verification link

#### You can follow the instructions [here](https://www.github.com/ZeyadMoustafaKamal/to-do) to setup the project successfully
